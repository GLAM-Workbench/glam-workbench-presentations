 Weather Forecasting. Mr. W ragge has computed forecasts for the seasons of Australia up till 1930,, and these, he says, are applica ble to Hew, Zealand, with slight.mod- ifications. ' During 1914 and part of 1915, lie says, the rainfall, ! taking Australasia as a whole, will' be under tne average, mis Dy no means im plies that there will be no rain , 'Oil the contrary, good intervening rains will occur, and the last part of this period, will be better than the, first. From' the middle of 1915; onwards, the rainfall will markedly increase, and from 1916 to 1920, inclusive, the seasons will be distinctly good, with abundant precipitation. After 1920 the rainfall will begin to steadily fall off, and the worst part of the next great "under average" period will be 1923 and 1924. Australians will be justified in calling that- a drought. In 1925 matters will begin to improve, and good seasons will prevail from 1925 to 1930. These forecasts, ex plained.
