 Wragge's Latest. Mr Clement Wragge offers some recent observations on the nniversal subject of the weather. "The only immediate prospect of intervening showers in inland . and Riverina districts lies in the fact that the extreme northern edge of an Ant arctic depression, named ' Conroy,' is SSW from ' Leeuwin.' ' ConroyJ' means well, and to him farmers must look during the ensuing ten days' for a temporary refreshing precipitation. But two gigantic anti-cyclones, or high pressure systems, on either side, are doing their utmost, as it were to block him, and it must candidly be admitted that the situation away, from the coq;s.t looks very serious. Solar conditjiaqs still spell drought, as special observations , cleai'ly show, while opposite effects have been, and will yet be, manifest in the Northern Hemisphere, to wit, the American floods — negative and positive etheric vibrations operating respectively by wireless waves linking np the sun with the earth. - "How much longer must we sound I the warning note; We knew inrl904' that 1912 would be a bad year in continental Australia. I frankly told' J the "people, so eight years ago, and j was laughed at by those who had , neither the biains_hor the wisdom to j understand. But to cry at the pre sent time would be absurd. Now is I the time for manly action on the part of the farmers and pastoralists ! Let them be up and doing — let them make wells, dam the little creek beds on their holdings. Conserve ! converve ! and let not the proverbial ' drop ' of I any intervening rain - go to waste ! Remember, Wragge is your best friend !"
