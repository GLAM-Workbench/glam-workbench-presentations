Mr. Vragge again dealt with Ihis sun-spot theory as affecting the rainfall. He bed predictel that 1912 would be a year of - rainfall below tile average, and his prediction had been borne oul. He ex pected tthat 11113 would be a lean- year, although probably tile rainfall would be greater than during 1912. From 1013 however, the seasons would improve, and the rainfall would be Ienerous for the 111t4 to 1922, after whltch another drf" spell could be expected.
