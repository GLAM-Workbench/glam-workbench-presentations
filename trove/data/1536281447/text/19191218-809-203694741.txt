 our uneasy planet. A DISTURBING PREDICTION. ' Notwithstanding tbe disturbing, prophecy which has been attributed— on what grounds we do not know— to. our old friend Mr. Clement Wragge, now of New Zealand, to the effect , that the astronomical posi- tions of the sun and planets on 17th December would be "ominous and signi ficant," and that the axis of , the,, earth might . "wobble" — which, of course, gave rise to the usual rumor that, the , uneasy earth would never whirl its way in safety out of yesterday's darkness, tiie greater part of Victoria - fa reading "The Age" with its cocoa and customary calm this morning, conscious of no universal night- mare, and the planet breathes again — and not asthmatically. Perhaps some trembling mortals, heaved aighs of. still half-troubled relief, to find on waking thia, morning fbat' they had hot been carried away, by. the tidal wave, the expectation of which bad taken such a hold of the popular imagination. But the world which has survived the dooming prophecies of Mother Shipton and several others contrives to take these pro- dictions in a fairly philosophic spirit. Of course, there are many credulous . peoplo who dwell with superstitious fear , on the contemplation of these /end-of-the- world predictions. Some few, it is said, , have squandered their substance in one last long &lt;jag, determined to die. merry j some 4aa1« annual UftliHaTR pnrlv. SO OS HOt to miss them; some read H. G. Wells and books on cyclones; some shut the windows, turned the gaB off at- the ineter, and re tired early last night; some went to cburcb la9t Sunday. Most remarked on the color of the sky, and expressed .tiie opinion, that Mr. Wragge was responsible for some dirty weather, anyhow.
