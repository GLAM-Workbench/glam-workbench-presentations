 OFFICIAL WARNINGS. Without commenting upon the prediction of Air. Wragge in New Zealand that there would be a renewal of cyclonic disturbances in Queensland before 1st April, the officials of the Commonwealth Meteorological Ba reau point out that no prophetic instinct ^was necessary to render such a general prediction possible-. Far years past the publications of the bureau had shown, by maps and bulletins that the 'hurricane Eea: son for the north-east coast of Queensland extends from January to April, and that the rain and storm periods for practically all parts of the Commonwealth have been ascertained as the result of many years' experience and the collection of data by thousands of observers. Forecasts in vague general terms were of little yalue to liari ners and the mercantil ccommunity. What the people of North Queensland and the traders and mariners needed were specific warnings. The bureau used every effort to supply these, together wiiii implicit in structions to whipping. Four days' notice had 'been given of the Mac-kay storm, and a warning concerning the cyclone reported in Tuesday's 'Age' Iliad been issued on Friday ln.-t. This latter warning also had been supplemented by detailed instructions on Sunday. ?
