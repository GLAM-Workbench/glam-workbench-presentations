We visited the Tower | of London, and they saw the "Traitor's .Gate," the site of the scaffold where people used to be shortened, the idle soldiers, the ancient "Beefeaters," and all the armor and the guns and swords and crossbows, and weapons, of mur der. They were greatly interested, and when we came out I said, "Now, boys, what interested you most about the Tower? What is the strongest Im pression that you bring away from the old place?" The bigger and older of the two (nearly 15) said:—"Well, my strongest impression, after seeing all the armor and the weapons of war Is that the people of those times were fools."
