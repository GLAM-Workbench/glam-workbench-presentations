"Northerner" writes:-Anent the drought, the recent heat spell, and the prospects of the rain which promises and never comes, it is curious to note thit when Queensland summer rains come early they slacken off before Christmas, and a wet summer comes to the south of the continent. Why it should be so even Mr. Wragge doesn't profess to know, but it has been the case frequently in the past. A happy monsoon struck the north last week, and it was to the extent of 21 inches in one part of the tropics. Though this is nothing to talk about in those climes where during the monsoon time any place north of Townsville which doesn't get its ten Inches or so of rain a week considers itself in the throes of a fearful drought, the fact remains that the. monsoons are early this season, and if history repeats it self we are going to have a summer broken up by Southern Ocean anti cyclones which spell rain for the south of the continent. The pearl fishers at Thursday Island and Darwin have a motto to the effect that an early monsoon means a placid summer, and when they have a placid one we have a wet one. We can do with it. It isn't so much that a woman wouldn't, but she hates to think that you think she would.
