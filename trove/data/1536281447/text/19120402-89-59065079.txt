 MR. WRAGGE AND THE WEATHER. From Clement Wragge. Ghiltern, Vic toria:— ''Just allow me bo say, in simple jtrstice, that if the Central Weather Bureau, Brisbane, had been in existence, the vote for which did not exceed £1,500' per annum, three days' warning at least would have been given of the recent cyclone off the north-west coast of Australia.'
