 LESSONS FROM CALAMITIES, .' Whoever will carefully read the story of the cyclonic visitation on. our northern coast may learn a lesson as to the caution born from experience of former calamities. Our memories are tender anil keen of feeling concerning the loss of life suffered on our northern coast when the Yongala went down to unexplored depths of the sea. Even at that time, there' were prudent ship comthanders who, fore seeing the. evil, took shelter from the storm. Experience is a faithful teacher; Now wc know, having so long sat at her feet, that on our northern coast 'at this season of the year, cyclones may prevail. It still' is vividly in memory that Mr. Wragge's , Sigma wrought so much mischief at Townsvillc, threatening almost to carry away the ugly bluff headland that looms over the city. - So. far, on this occa sion, it appears that no lives have been lost. This welcome state of affairs indis putably is due to tho prudence with which ship commanders have managed their cralts in those dangerous northern waters, dangerous when cyclones are roaming tliq sea. It is said that the Innamincka is aground. For the present wo may sur mise that her commander deemed risks near, shore to be less than risks in the open water, whilst a cyclone was raging. Until otherwise informed— and -ire . hope it will be impossible to supply the infor mation—the immunity from loss of life this time experienced is due to the lessons in prudence taught by the -calamities' that? befell us when the Yongala foundered.
