 Meteorological Notes15. 1897.-A Very Bad Year. If there is anything in the theory of three good years and three bad ones, we have it illustrated in the eighteen hundreds. I have shown in previous articles that the years 1894-6 were favorable ones for rain; indeed 1896, until this year was a record for coastal and central country floods. The year of cyclone, floods, and disaster was followed to use the words of my records by a very bad year." It will be interesting to re- member if next year will be a dry one, following the excessive wet opening of 1917. The year 1897 com- menced wth the rain totals below the average over most of the State. They were above the normal in the Cen tral Division, also around the Gulf, near Cunuamulla, and between Surat, Miles, and Taroom. In February rain was registered in most of the eastern districts, but the totals were below the average generally over the State, except at one or two isolated places. Like in the previous month rain in March was below the average gene rally, but above in small isolated patches. April rainfall was much he low generally. No ram fell west from the coast disrticts-1« inches below at Innisfail (where it is always supposed to be raining), 5 inches be low at Mackay, U inches below at Brisbane. May was very dry and be low average generally- Again no ram fell west from coast districts. Totals slightlv above normal between (filbert River. " Maytown, and Herberton. To tals for last six months show Imsfail 69 inches below normal, Mackay ii inches below normal, Rockliamptou 17 i inches below normal, Brisbane 14 inchcs below normal. There was a tecovprv in June, as rain fell and was above the average all over most of the State, except coast districts from Townsville southward, round tho Gulf and Peninsula north from Fairview; also over an area extend ; jnjr froui tin* Gulf towards Ayrshire Downs and Hugheuden, and fTT thsvc eastwavd to tho poaboanl. iJut it did not continue. Practically no lulu fell inland in July, but H was labovn -normal -Monsr th* coast south i from Jiowen and generally south-east !i om liiie joining St. George and Gayndah. also on the north coast be tween Cooktowii and Innisfail. In August raiu was generally below the average. A. littio raiu was registev ed on the north coast, otherwise no rain > fell over the the western and northern halves. The totals were above the average on the coast Be tween Bowen and Gladstone and ex tended inland to Muttaburra, also (was slightly above on south-east Darling Downs and near Gjmpie. ! There were fair rains iu the north in I September. South from a looming Monkira, Ayrshire Downs, Hugheu den. Pentlaijd, Ravenswood, Elgin Downs, Muttaburra. Forest Vale, Taroom. and Rocbhampton the ram was above normal; also above fj"°m Herberton northward to Coen. Rest of the State below the average. Octo ber was a good wet month, and above the average generally, except across the base of the Peninsula^ and be tween Blackall, Ada vale, and Foiest Vale; also over southern Maranoa and Peninsula between Coen, .*? crave and Cooktown. November w as a bad mouth generally, but the ram was above the average between Mut taburra, Taroom, and Mackay; also near Brisbane and on the extreme north of the Peninsula. Decenibei was a fairly, wet month; above noi mal north and welt of a line joining Cardwell, Gilbert River, Carandotta, Boulia, and just west of Birdsville; also between Townsville, Pe"u"Vd' Eeiu Downs, and Mackay, and ver> Ky south'of Tropic of Capricorn, and east from Charles ille. Below the average in most central and south-western districts The year summed up was a very bad one °nl> isolated patches were above the an nual average. The largest.areas above the normal were in the Gulf country from Burketown and eastward of Donnors Hill, and most of the Darling Downs. In the coast districts the following figuies for the six months (Decembei, 1S9G, to May, 1917) give some idea of the drv snell:-Inisfail was 69.08U1. oe Ifow normal; Mackay, 32.17i^; Rock hampton, 17.4Siu.; and Brlehane, 14.34in. __ So mucli for generalities, we wm have a look at some of the,records for the vear taken in the widely-dis SbS* centres, but that during the yeaT 1897 haa in creased from 502 to 504. Taking first Blackall as the central meteoro-oh sorvation station we find that during the year the total was only of which (all the following will he in points of 100 to the gauge inch), 370 points fell in January, June had 332, September 119, 0c^b,er December 100. No rain fell 'a April, May, and November; other mondis under an inch. Rain fell on 44 days. Taking the Central Highlands-Lo gan Downs had 1955 on 32 days, Alpha! 1656 on 48 days; BoganUn gan, 1893 on 57 days; c°met, 2325 on 52 days; Duaringa, 3112 on 60 days. Emerald, 2382 on 50 days. So that east of the Range the best rains fell. Northampton Downs measured 1" 15 on 51 days; Terrick Terrick ,208a ob 60 days. Centralj Lowlands -Alice Downs, 1374 on 27 days; Alice,1720 on 45 days; Aramac, 1343 on ZB days * Barcaldine, 1462 on 65 days; Barcaldine Station, 1545; Beacons fleld, 1154 on 21 days; Bowen Downs. 1100 on 30 days; Coreena, 1289 oii 33 days; Darr River Downs, 1545, Emmett Downs, 1485 on 33 days, Evesham, 1183 on 20 dayB; Evora, 1642 on 23 days; "^acomba had just commenced, and haft »2 in ember only on four days; Iais Downs, I 1270 on 31 days (no days for Octo ber); iBlsford, 1351 on 29 dayB; Jdricho, 2307 on 36 days; Kensing ton Downs, 1537 on 27 days; Long reach, 1306 on 26 days; Malvern Hills, 1416 on 43 'days; Maneroo, 990 on 23 days; Mount Cornish, 9086 on 39 days; Muttaburra, 1810 on 37 days; Portland Downs, 1209; Rockwood, 1136 on 31 days; Ruthven, 1555 on 29 days; Saltern, 910 on 23 days; Sal tern Creek, 1540; Stainburn, 1316 on 40 days'; Tangorin, 1274 on 33 days; Wellshot, 1673 on 22 days; West land, 839 on 21 days. Taking a few items from tlxe Upper and Lower Western we find Winton scored only 920 on 28 days; Boulia, 531 on 27 days; Currawilla, 478; Bimerah, 918 j on 16 days; Diamantlna Lakes, 674 ou 26 days; Jundali, 657 on 24 days; Glenorniiston (taken up by the late James Tyson as a cattle ranch), 337 ?on 9 days; Palparara, 445 on 17 days; Windorah, 505 on 28 days; Pne pah, 614 on 11 days, the heaviest fall being two inches in January, 120 in March, 155 in June; there were six dry months, including February; Charleville had 1882 on 32 days; Tambo, 1731, and St. George 1220. In my previous article I mentioned that 1SS6 was the year of extraor dinary rains and cyclonic disturb ances in the North. Wragge's pre dicted hurricane "Sigma" fell with full force ou Townsville and did very great damage. It would be interest ing to compare that year's rainfall with the present, 18#0" figures being in parenthesis:-Cairis (9424). 6651; Port Douglas (94E1), 5802; Towns ville (6670), 5024; Uowen <6507), 3523; Mackay (7138 >, 1662; liouk hampton (5981), 3150. It will be lioted the difCerenec is not eo great considering. As already pointed out drought con ditions prevailed in the earlier part of the year all over the State, the first five months being particularly dry. There had been a succession of dry months since Feb. 1896, except for partial rainfalls recorded dur ing the months of April, July, and November of that year. The condi tions over most of the southern half of the Stale were, however, relieved by good rains in June and September, 1897, but it was not "until December of that year that rain sufficiently heavy to break up the drought for the time being occurred over the Northern districts of the Gulf country. In May, 1897, the Official Observer in connection with the Meteorological Dept. obtained reports from many parts of the State. From these re ports it appears the Central-West was not in a really serious condition, but in the Northern hinterland the drought was being sorely felt. Itich mond Downs reported: Managers of neighboring stations ; assert that drought conditions not yet in evi dence, but grass and water becoming scarce much sooner than expected; heavy winter rains anxously looked for. Tarbrax reported that grass was more plentful than it was dur ing the previous year. Bedourie says: -"Driest season experienced for 14 years." Glenorraiston: - ''Drought compares favorably with that of 1892." Hammond Downs:-"Drought most severe and of long duration." In the Central Highlands Emerald Downs states:-"Existing drought worst ex perenced lor years." St. Helens made a similar report. .The general reports I from the Darling Downs were that the drought was the worst experienced since 1SS3. Stock iif good order, but grass very scarce; country in bad' position to face winter. Westbrook says:-"The most serious drought experienced during residence of 25 years." Of course so much dry weather in the earlier part of the year induced heat, and the glass soared fairly high on occasion. At Charters Towers it was reported that the thermometer on the 24th January marked 100 degs. at 10 p.m. Frosts were experi- enced from mid-June right up to the end of August. On the 26th and 27th the min. temperature at Stanthorpe was 28degs. The frosts appear to have been general over the Darling Downs and Logan districts; there were no abnormally cold days in the Central-West. On the 25th Jan. there was a cyclonic hailstorm at Bunda- berg; on the 25th Sept., a severe hailstorm at Maryborough; on the 1st November a severe storm with unprecedented hail, passed over Bris- bane. On the 8th March there was a grasshopper plague in the vicinity of Cairns and Georgetown. On the 8th July Bowen reported that ticks were numerous, and red water prevalent in the district. In July it was stated that ticks were prevalent at places here and there in the northern districts. On 28th Decem- ber an unusually violent storm pas- sed over Brisbane. On the 23rd July Toowoomba had a fall of snow; all the streets houses, fences, trees, &c., were covered with a white mantle. There had been a similar visitation some years previously. On the 16th June at Croombit (five miles from Cania, Gladstone district), a shock of earthquake was felt just before sun- rise, accompanied by a noise like two heavily-charged blasts, explod- ing, one after the other, at a great depth below the surface of the ground. The ground trembled, and the furniture in some of the houses moved. The motion appeared to come from the west. About ten minutes later a rumbling noise, like thunder far away to the eastward was heard. cjj
