 : LOOKING : BACKWAID." The following is an, extract from a rd port which appeared in '! The Horshnm Times" of a lecture delivered in,. Hor shak? lyi Mr. Clement L. Wragge on De cember 10th, 1002 :-" The trough of the sun spot minimum thrgugh which we had been passing fell about the end" of 1900, and the :succeeding , minimum was due about 1911. Thus we omight expect in creased -energy in our atmospheric sys tem-cyclone and anti-cycle such as have lately been experienced in Queenstand and Now:South- Wales, with dn increase in rainfall.' While the more liberal rain fall was in shason preparation should to made for the follo-wing minimum, due about 191-1. Let the rivers be iocked and other steps takens to cnuserve the water and minimise the evils of drtought. Ifesdid not say that a maximm -.rain fall would actually be -experienced pre cisely at:the time n-amed, but he would bay that goodseasons .were surely evolv Ing-that -1903 would witness a marked difference. and that 1904-5-6 would pro bably be good years in these Austral lands. If the drodght would only arouse the people of this great country and teach them a- lesson--to -conserve water when there was plenty, and to lock the rivers,-then it would not have been all loss."
