 NO RAIN. AN TJNFAVO____BLE OFT LOOK. j The -eenest d__*&lt;_r>-î_t_-ïnfc will bf* felt | ! on every hand at the news that the pro- mise of rain contained in Thursd-y even- j ing's weather report« is not to be fulfill.'d i for tlie present at all event». Ai an eariy hour on Friday the atmospheric conditions ««eeraed to «Jestrov the hope, and as the day wore on gustv northerly winds set in. i driving clouds of dust over the city etr»_*_ ¡ The position became so bad that it wa-s found niKessary to order out the water car_; to sprinkle th« principal thorough- fare«*-- most unusual proceeding at this time of the .year. Throughout th" day the hill« Avcre enveloped in a thick dust haze, which entirely excluded then, from view, and in localities where there wat, heavy traffic tbe dust was quite as bad as in tiie middle of summer. Reports from all parts of the. country tell 1 of auxiety on the part of the produc-cri owing to the prolonjred absence of rain. Al- ready the pastoral industry has been se riouslv affected, and if rain does not come soon the agricultural operations for this vear will not be so successful' as has been the case durrng recent years, in districts . where lambing is in progress it has been ' found necessary to kill the lambs in order j to save the ewes. There ia an entire a«V sence of feed in nearly all agricultural and Lastoral districts, and the outlook has not been more ¡serious' for many years. Wnere . dairying operations are carried on there has been a great reduction in the yield of muk. In the city and su'ourbs dairymen are feeling the pinch, as iuppiies are run- ning short, and it is excccd.ngly difficult to provide sufficient for all reliar cus-' . ton» ers. . Tor the general weif are of the j State it is much to be hoped that a soaking general rain will .be recorded before many days are over. If not there is every pro- bability that »Mr. Wragge's pied-'ct.on of a hard winter tvill be realised to the full. The weather officer reported at noon »»n Friday-"South Australia seems doomed to disappointment, for conditions this morn- ing point to another failure of the atmtis pherk pressure conditions to bring general ! rain over this State. The chart shows that a rapid change has taken place «nee I yesterdav", the mon«oonal influence being absorbed by a southern low, and the com- bination has been forced southward by another energetic anti-cyclone whi:_ has nushtd in from the ivest coast of Western Australia. This system has extended as far as Eucla, and hitrh pressure conditions still existinz over tlie eastern States the depression is beine forced awav south, t-o that indications now are only for show?ry wealicr over the southern districts, with fresh westerly winds.'' ' The 9 p.m. report stated:-"Except for the far Avcstern districts, where cool j sonth-ire-t winds were blowin". warm ' and unpleasant weather has been experi- enced over thi- State to-day. Temperatures Avere generally over 70 «leg., and the highest shade reading was recorded at Adelaide, viz., 77.8 deg. From later reports condi- tions do not show any improvement in the Avay of bringing a good rain over South Australia, though before the disturbed at .mosphere can become more settled ive may expect some showers over the southern i districts." I WHYTE-YARCOWIE. May 16.-Feed is1 scarce in the paddocks, but most fanu?r-> have sufficient hay to last them through the winter. That they have sufficient in due to the fact that the severe frosts '.'* November compelled many farmers to cut moie of their crop« for hay than they other- wise vyou'd have done. Many lambs, how-j ever, have died. At present the ew«s arei liying chiefly on «eeds. Horses have de pi eciated about 20 peT cent, all round in value, n-hile store cattle and sheep are al- most un-talcablt*. In some instances far- mers are resoiting to artificial feeding of sheep, uring chaffed straw and molasses, i Tlie area under wheat Avili be quite equal ' to la«t year, but seeding operations ara ' somewhat retarded owing" to the dry wei- ther. Nearly all the dams are drv, and the «"cai-city of water for household pur I poses is becoming alarming. Each day ibe weather map jof "The Advertiser'- is eagerly scanned bv anxious residents.' . ¡ WAURALTEE, Mav 15.-Owing lo the long spell of dry weather water is scarce. Mauy peorle ate cart'ng from the sand- ' hills and Mount Rat wells. Should the rain hold off another fortnight the lambing «?easor« will be a poor one. Seeding is in full swinr-. Today a heavy north wind i blew, and there is indication of a good I downpour. - " . THE MAY KAINFALL. AVERAGES AND CONTRAST-.
