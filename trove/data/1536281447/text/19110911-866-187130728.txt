 " WADE," AND " M'GOWEN " ? Sir. Clement L. Wragge, tho distinguished meterologist, will, during his ptay in Sydney, issue an exclusive forecast daily for "Tlie Sun." He had something more to say concerning tlie disturbances "Wade" and "McGotv&lt; and he predicts "rising temperatu: iu Sydney—presumably in Maequarie street. He writes :— Conditions as we write are full'of potent meaning to him who can hear the music of the isobars. Over Southern Victoria is an anti-cyclonic or high pressure nucleus, the slopes from which covcr the easu-rn half of the continent, implvjng generally line weather «>ver all that area, thus including Sydnev. during the earlv future. The &lt;omro of "Wilde" is 0fT the Bluff, and "Mcfiowt'ii" is looming up, full of mischief, over the ocean south-cast from the Ixs?uwin, Oddly enough, those two disturbances are linked together in the up}>er "fifties" by nn arterial vein of low pressure, after tho fiiAhion of the Siamese twin?, and the result in higli southern latitudes will l>e heavy westerly blows, with 6mftiR and hackings between uorth nud south, while thfc.\vhal&lt;v birds look on and enjoy tho fan. " fore five days have expired "MoGow will have reached the meridian of Sydney, and his approach will be heralded by rising temperatures and northor- !y currents along! the southern seaboard betweeu Kangaroo Island nnd Gabo, affecting also inland districts. Altogether, the mcterological chessboa I'd is replete with interest, and from our conning tower in tho city, aided hv out instniments.wo shall serenolv watch the course of events. Now is t)ie time for good sea passages between Adelaide Vnrt Jackson, aim Queensland i>orte. CLEMENT h . WUAOGE. September 6, 1911.
