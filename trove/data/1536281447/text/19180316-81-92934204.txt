 WINDS ON AN AWTUL SCALE.; Mr. (fiement W|raggie makes ■■ (says' the "Auckland Weekly News") the following remarks on the. weather:—'' Another "upheav al, in the sun, about 12,000 miles in diameter, is approaching the centre or solar disc. To these- abnormal conditions is certainly at tributable the Chinese earthquake, and also earth tremors in New Zealand, and the South African floods. Winds on an awful scale, with gigantic tougne3 of hydrogen, flame around these solar storms in exactly the same manner as do the winds around the puny cyclones. of earth, northern and- southern hemispheres, respectively; and it must ever be remembered that, the earth and the &lt;nm. are inseparably linked together by the all pervading wiroless etheric waves. Such affect- not only our atmosphere; but also in dustrial affairs and the vagaries of 'human nature at this critical time." •
