Cook is once inore in the comatose state or the som nambulistic stagger. In Um matter of meteorological information,, the wide and vast State, of Queensland has to depend upon its data from the Central station at Brisbane. Thus where the telegraphic system is nearly always rup tured, the isolated cyclonic North doesn't know when to expect the next somersaulting turn from .1. PIuviub. Consequently the North is getting sick of losing thousands of pounds in one act and leaving D. Jones a. ship or two like the Yongala.
