 WEATHER BUREAU AND LATE CYCLONE. (To the Editor.) Sir,--Just allow me to say, in simple justice, that if the Central Weather Bu reau, Brisbane, had been in existence -the annual vote for which did not exceed Â£ 1500 per annum-three days' warning at least would have been given of the recent cyclone off the north-west coast of Australia.-Yours, etc., CLEMENT L. WRAGGE. Chiltern, Victoria, March 29.
