 I Nr. Predictions I From A.F..B-, Cottesloe:-In an article on the son spot theory Mr. Wrasse said: "It takes the son just ' about three and a half years to get I from the time of its lower energy to i the time of its highest energy, and I then the opposite change gradually I begins. Ton will reach the crest of ) the wave about 1904, good seasons I will probably embrace 1906 and part: I of 1907. Then, if yon axe wise, you i will be prepared to see the seasons* I gradually grow drier. With, the dis I appearance of the sun spots at last, I within 1912-13 you will probably i reach the climax in another drought, ' bat not so severe as the last one. i "Many foolish folk will cry once ' more, 'Oh, old Wragge is mad!' I I am barely in my prime, but I shall not quarrel with them over my age or my knowledge. Let them go on thinking that my brain is as strlp I pied as the plums in 'spotted dog.' What does it matter? I have spoken the truth, and, ever remember, there is no higher religion. "Well, watch and prove my theor- ies for yourselves. The son .will soon be in the height of his energy-In the zenith of his valuable career, with bis gigantic cyclones and anti-cyclones In full play. Watch the papers and the cablegrams, and you will surely read of heavy disturbances, rains, floods and gales all over the world, espe- cially in Australia, New Zealand. Tasmania and Antarctica.''
