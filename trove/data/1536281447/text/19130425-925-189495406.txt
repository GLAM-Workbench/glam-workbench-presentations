' iianra residente had a great treat on Thursday evening last when , (»eiae.nt Wragge. the eminent «stronomsr~ and and. meteorologist, ' presented his popular lecture, 'A r ybyage through the Universe,' to a '? crowded audience in the Laura Town Halt. It -would be w«U nigh impjr ^able to«onvey Co anyone who was not there any idea t-f the remarkable soope embraosd in this wonderful leoture. It U necessary to seo and hear this scientist to get any conception. By , the help of laotera views Mr, Wragge handled his subject in a masterly manner and held his audience spell. ' bound ai he showed and explained the great wonders of the universe. The ' ' mighty sunB rolling at inconceivable AiafknMka thrnnoh «nace. in their ooantleBB millions apon millions are tdmoit too much for the mind to . grasp^andwasitfiWingthattheleotnrer should say 'The Heavens declare the glory of God and the Earth showeth His handiwork. Mr. Wragge dw#lb eaphatioatly on Intelligence ' and Design and Great-Central Power. ??Science and True Religion are one' asserted- the lecturer, No sane man oouldlrolf be an atheist and science had rwe«Ied wigdom and beneficence. There oonld-be no death for what was ««Ued death was bat change. Science *pd religion were one and indivisible, and the study of Mtronomy assisted in tbe realisation of this fact. Com . plaints were made about half empty churches, bat if clergymen dwelt otbener on those sublime themes whiob sosehb to ?nligbten on the majesty of God's creations sueh would tiot be the ease, and something would be given t? cause refleotion through the week and develop the sense of reverence and )ove- Photos were flashed on the ' soreenihe spots betokening gigantio dUturbanaea Blithe «nn. Mr; Wrasge ?xplsjnedhow these son spots affected the- weather. Beautiful pictures of , ^qe moon were shown on tbe Bcreen, and the audience listened in wrapt T sAtoation^as the wonders of a long ' since dead world were pointed out to them. After the lecture Mr. Wragge STe a, farther address on Badium. e showsd ' a piece of pitoh blende Jm also showed the 'Alpha' rays Ihrown off hy the ' metal, and also the '''.

There wfll b« some ttvete thandetstonns. For May we can anticipate further useful falls. June will have about the average rainfall, with some severe frosts. July rainr will be more eoastaV with some severe frosts to follow, and August nsefull rains, probably heavy after tbe middle of tbe montb. September — Hardly up to the average rainfall, cyclonic winds between ohanges. October — Steady, useful, and probably fairly general rains, and before the middle of the month. November— Some heavy partial r thunderstorms. December — Heavy1, rains, and probably before Christmas So the result of the season of 1913, from a farmer's point of view, will be somewhat similar to the season 1012, although some of the northern areas tw wen tortnoate last season nay be more lucky this time. The squatter will have an extremely good season.' BONNINGTON'S IRISH MOSS. With -the winter months come coughs and odds, bronchits, Influenza, and asthma. .
