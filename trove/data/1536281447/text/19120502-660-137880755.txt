 WRAGGE'S LATEST. WARNINC TO FARMERS. j Mr. Clement Wragge offers some recent observations on the universal subject of the weather. ' The only immediate prospect of intervening showers in inland and Riverina district lies in the fact that extreme northern edge of an antarctic depression, named ' Conroy,' is S.S W. irom 'jueeuwin. Uonroy ' means well, and to him farmers must look during tbe ensuing ten days for a temporary refreshing precipitation. But two gigantic anti cyclones, or high pressure systems, on either side are doing their utmost, as it were, to block him, and it must candidly be admitted that the situatioa away from the coast looks very serious. Solar conditions spell drought, as special observations clearly show, while opposite effects have been, and will yet be manifest in the Northern Hemisphere, to wit, the American floods— negative ' and posi tive etheric vibrations operating re spectively- by wiroless waves linking up the sun with the earth. ' How much longer must we sound the warning note. We knew in 1904 that 1912 would be a bad year in con tinental Australia. I frankly told the people so eight years ago, arid was laughed at by those who had neither ?brains nor the wisdom to understand. iJut to ory at tnei present time would be absurd. Now is the time for manly action on the part of the farmers and pastoralists. Let them be up and do ing—let them make wells, dam the little creek beds on their holdings, con* serve, conserve, and let not the pro verbial ' drop ' of any intervening rain run to waste. Remember, Wragge I is your best friend.'. . I Mr. Wragge lecturos here next Wed* nesday night.
