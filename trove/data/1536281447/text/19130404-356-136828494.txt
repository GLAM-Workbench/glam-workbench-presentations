 " ULYSSES." When Prognostcator Wragge gets busy with antl-cyclones storm-centrs, and drouights, people begin to sit up and take notice. Now tbis waeaher enpert sun donlsy finds ham.eif listening to the voice o1f "Ulynsue," this being his hbghu-floee same for some Sort of a shake-up which Sydney is given twelve days to propare for. .I bane no more definite ktnowledgs of this modern "Ulysses," the Wragge. time favourite, than of the illustrious Ulysses of mvthologi~al days, who played last and loose with the affections of the Sirens of the Aegean Islands. Tht "Ilyssaes" didn't hother Sydney much. from all accounts, nor do I aoticipate that this coming one will be any more terlrifying than a oslitical meeting at ondit or "notice" from a. police-loving cook bent on matrimony. Still, the tlraggcd one's prophcc.in are always entertatning. They're like Tattersall's consultations. You never know. But it it be true that "Ulysses" Is going to chase lts all out of our homes into the "undiscovered country from whose hournms no traveller retlurns," I earnestly appeal to the strife-promoters and strike en gineers one and all to "cease frotm troubling" ulntil the twelve days are uyp. The voice of St. Peter calling the roll srould he drowned by the clamour el discontented workers wrangling over hours and wages were the end to come to-day. So be good, all of you, for a tew days-Wragge may be right this tlme and sing gladly the good old song, "There is a Happy Land." No matter it unsympathetic larrlkins do yell out,' "Where is it?" To Ulysses! Glasses!
