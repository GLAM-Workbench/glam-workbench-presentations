From this source, reacting ?

He ?till- retained the con fidence ofC the people and this was something 'which lesser minds do not seem to have been able to forgive him. At all events repeated and per sistent efforts were madc! to have Mr. Wragge (. classed as anything but a true scientist ' His 'long distance' forecasting was held up to ridicule as a sort of scandalous indulgence in wild empiricism- at the expense of incteoro,logscSlj science. We have al ways been among those who regarded Mr. Wragge as perhaps the one true ?scientist in the domain' of natural phenomena in this country. ? siucc he is anoriginal investigator, with theor ies and views of bis -own, 'and has t^evcr been content, to merely follow i'h the footsteps of other people and accept without question, or search ing; independent1 examination, the so ; called1 established scientific truths and .facts of those who have gone over the same ground before him.. Of course Mr. Wragge .is -notan'' orthodox r or Icpnventional Scientist- ?'; M he -tJ-ere his services -woiild not have been of ;h3lf as much value '.to the -cqunjtry js^ they are.- In some measure fie rh-i' the eccentricity which is commonly associated- with; gen~ius-^thcref ore, ; in ithe 'inculaf and .limited judgment of the xonventSonsfl inind' of science, he is4not a 'true scientist,': but some ihinjr:of a mountebank and a little-of . tile fakir. But whatcvpr. Mr. Wragge r is; or 'is not, he has the melancholy Satisfaction of -having scored an im inerise and conclusive triumph over tws critics and the people wno toonsn-.. ly attached importance to their-:indir-; ect attacks on him as a weather, pvo^ phet.

These forecasts, explains Mr. Wragge, are mainly based on the physical con-, dition of .the sun \vith respect to its maxima and minima moods, moving in cycles of eleven; years, just now we are ncaring the end oi the solar jninimum^-or, (he period when1 . the fearful cyclonic winds arourid the sun,' of which we on earth had no.concep-, tion, were least violent.
