 31 INTEIRESTING PREDICTION? In view of the rbcurrence of cyclones over 1the eastern part ,of 'Australia it is Interesting to recall a prediction which was made by Xr. Clement Wragge at the time of the disaster at Makay-. "Atmospheric conditions," Mr. Wragge said, "are very perturbed within lower latitudes than that of Auckland, espe cially over alt North Cape, the Kerma decs, Tonga, Fiji, New Caledonia, Nor folk Island, and the coasts of Queens= land and New South Wales. A close watch should- bd kept on the baro meter. The disastrous storms in Queensland, coupled with the floods, are sufficient indication of the general type of weather, and in various parts of the eastern half of Australia there may, and probably will, be a renewan of such before let April, hence every precaution should be taken. As stated in January, the coast of "Western Aus, tralia,-north from Shark ilay,- may be affected bye- winds of the hurricane type;, and the pearling fleets should be on the alert. I am confirmed in the opinion that the southern edges of the tropical disturbances will pass further south than.usual, and ,their penumbrae may even extend .to the Bay of Plenty and, Ha'wke's Bay, N.Z;, under . cur. rents from between south-east, east, north-east( and north, shifting' westerly; blowing strong; and with a very con -iderable rainfall -before two months have elapsed. These conditions -are mainly due to abnormal solar in fluence."
