 "WADE," AND "M'fiOWEN." DISTURBANCES LINKED TOGETHER. rising temperatures predicted, mr. wragge's special forecast. Mr. Clement U Wragge. the distinguished meteorologist, will during his stay in Sydney Ismuo an excluslvo forecast dully for "The Sun." To-day he has more to say concern ing tho disturbances "Wade" and "M'Gowen," and he predicts "rising tempera- tures ' Jn Sydney— presumably in Macquorle- street. He writes:— Conditions as we write are full of potent meaning to him who can hear, tho music of the Isobars. Over Southern Vlctorlu la uu anti-cyclonic or high pressure nucleus the slopes from which cover the eastern hulf of the continent, implying generully Hn« we.i- ther over alt that area, thus including Syd ney, during the curly future. The centre of "Wade" is off th« Bluff, and "M'Gowen" In looming up, full of mischief, over the occnn south-east from the Icuwiu. Odd ly enough, these two disturbances are link ed together ill the upper "llftles" by an arterial vein of low pressure, after the fashion of the Siamese twins, and the result In high southern latitudes will be heave ! westerly blows, with shifts and backings j i between north und .south, while the whale- 1 i birds look on and enjoy the fun. Before five days have expired "M'Gowen" will haw reached the meridian of Sydney, and his ; approach will he heralded by rising tem peratures and northerly currents along tho southern seaboard between Kangaroo Island nnd Gabo, affecting also inland dis tricts. Altogether. the meteorological chessboard Is replete with Interest, nnd from our conning tower In the city, uldcd by our Instruments, wo shall serenely watch the course of events. Now Is the time for | good sea passages between Adetulde, Port Jackson, and Queensland ports. CLEMENT L. WRAGGE. September 5. 191L
