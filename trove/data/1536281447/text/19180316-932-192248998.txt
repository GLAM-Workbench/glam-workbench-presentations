 ' Rumored ' Willy- Willy An unusual amount of an xiety has been caused pearlers and others by the circulation in some newspapers of the story that ' it is rumored that Clement Wragge, the well known meteorologist, has pre dicted the Nor'-West will be visited by a terrific cyclone on March 22.' Why such credence should be placed in this ' rumor ' it is hard to understand, unless it be found j in the fact that many of! Wragge's prognostications have been realised. We can find no justification for the ' rumor/' unless it be in the fact that the ' rumored ' date almost exactly synchronises with the disastrous Kooinbaua blow (March 20/21, 1912), which destroyed so much shipping and lives. Most of us are familiar with Defoe's j description of the horrors of the early hours of Saturday morning, November 27, 1703, when all London rushed out of bed and *' cowered in cel lars,' the tinte when the first Eddystoue lighthouse was de stroyed, together with its designer, and Sir Cloudesley Shovel's fleet was shattered. When one reads 'rumors' vious horrors, it is small wonder the war-worn jumpy nerves of people are upset. We do not think the best interests of the Nor'-West have been served by the pub lication of a mere 'rumor' of this kind.
