 WRAGGtE'S LATEST. WARNING TO FARMERS. Mr Clement 'Wragge offers some re cent observations on the universal subject of the weather. • "T.he only immediate prospect of intervening showers in inland and Riverina district lies in the fact that the extreme northern edge of an Ant arctic depression, named "Conro'y," is S.S.W. from j'Leeuwin.' 'Conroy' means well, and to him farmers must look during the ensuing ten days for a temporary refreshing precipitation. But two gigantic anti-cyclones, or thigh-pressure systems, on either side are doing their utmost, ?as it were, to block him, and it must candidly be admitted that the situation away from the' coast looks very serious. Solar conditions-still spell drought, as spe cial observations clearly show, while opposite effects have been, and will yet be manifest in the . Northern Hemisphere, to wit, the American floods—negative and positive etheric vibrations operating' respectively by wireless waves linking up the sun with the earth. "How much longer must,we. sound the warning note. We knew, in 1904 that 1912 would be a bad year in con tinental Australia. I frankly told the people so eight years ago, and was laughed at by those who had neither the brains nor the wisdom to under stand; But to; cry at the present time would be absurd. Now is the time for manly action on the part of the farmers: aivd pastoralists. Let them be.up_and doing—let them make wells, dam the little creek-beds 011 their holdings, 1 conserve! conserve! and let not the proverbial 'drop' of any intervening rain run to waste. Remember, Wragge is your, best4, friend."
