 THE DRY SEASON. ABUNDANT RAINS FOLLOW DROUGHT. Mr. Clement Wragge- has prophesied seven years of drought. Mr. H. A. Hunt, Commonwealth? Meterologist, is content with one -year. On Wednesday he was par ticularly emphatic in pointing out that the season following a drought, and partiuu larly a severe drought, has been marked by abundant rains. In support of this view he quoted the drought of 1888, wvhich was followed, by a very wet year. In Victoria, during. 1888, the average rainfall was 19.7 inches. In 1889 it was 32.71 inches. The 1902 average of 18.55 inches preceded 27.45 inches in 1'03. This was just as marked in New South Wales: Mr. Hunt's explanation of this was tihat when the interior of Australia was very dry the solar summer radiation became intense, causing an inflow of moist winds from the tropics. The serious condition of Victorian. crops was chiefly due to the failure of the winter rains in the last two years. Victoria relied on winter rains for subsoil water, and the failure of the spring rains had. left nothing in reserve. Vic toria, Mr. Hunt stated, had three distinct sources of rain-(1) southern storms, which also benefited South Australia and south ern Western Australia,. though their pre dominance. made Queensland and New South Wales suffer from lack of rain; (2) tropical depressions, whose predomi nance, as was ithe case this year benefited Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales, to the detriment of southern areas; (3) anti-cyclonic conditions, which benefited solely the eastern littoral of Australia. This season the southern storms have failed.
