 THE APPROACHING RAINSTORM. Meru inteiost «¡ll !>«. talion in**the > in.storiii which tho I'ntniiinnwoulth Meteorologist >ays is approaching from tho westward. Apart from tho general rfiwro prevailing in Aio-tralia for tho break up ol tho dry s|x'll, which i.s now creating so lunch anxiety, tho piedic tion is intonating because it is an nt l Mupt to forecast loi a longer period ahead than is usually undertaken, lt i. moi about n ».*'k since Mr. Munt a 111111 n li i «'ii that there nasa disturbance coining from the west wlreh would give general rain» over a largo portion ol' Au-trali i. lt seems that tho de- pression, II Ireh is expected to produce tho iain, was evoi Wost Australia yes- terday on its ».iv eastwards, but on account ol' what ls known as an anti .vclone booie nie: lb. east const of Anstralin its progress was delayed and th" iain was not oNpsvtod tintl tho anti-cyclone mme* away.

Ho bases bis foris'nst on eutirelv di lieront data to that IISIKI l.v the offi eial inotisiri.lngist.. ami his fons,ist extends over several veals. If there is ,i isininiis general downpour ol rain m Mr. Hunt's predicted storm it will rather shake confidence in Mr. Wrngce's drought. The two forecasts are. however, not directly opposed to each other. Mr Wragges prediction is that, there will lie a general shortage in the rainfall in Australia this year. There might, of ooursn, be a hoavv fall tliis month, or in any ono month, anti still ho a substantial shortage in tile total for the year. Mr. Hunt's for^ä-, oast does not discuss that iihaae of the subject. He predicts good general rains in South Australia, Victoria;.'and New South Wales this week, and tho end of the week is now cloie at hand. The effect of a heavy fall ol' rain now would be to postpone Mr. Wi'iiggo's drought until after the winter. ,
