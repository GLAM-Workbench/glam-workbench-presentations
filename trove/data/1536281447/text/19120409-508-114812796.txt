 . THE WEST AUSTRALIAN CYCLONE. Mr. C. L. Wraggs writes:- I should never dream of entering into any controversy with Mr. Hunt, or any of his officers, and all their criticism of me matters nothing. They were office assistants when I was head of the Queensland Weather Bureau. Suffice it to say that accurate weather forecasting depends upon correct diagnosis of isobarlc contouring, and on knowing how to do things. Therein lies power, I shall say no more.
