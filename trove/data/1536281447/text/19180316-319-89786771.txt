 MR. \WRAGGE'S PREDICTION. RENEWAL OF CYCLONE FORETOLD. In Auckland on 3rd ,February Mr. Cle ment Wragge, the well-known Australian meteorologist, predicted that further atmospheric disturbances would occur in the southern tropics, including the north ern portion of New Zealand. "Atmospheric conditions," Mr. Wragge said, "are very perturbed within lower lati tu(des than that of Auckland, cspecially over all North Carpe, the Kermadecs, Tonga, Fiji, New Caledonia, Norfolk Island, and the coasts of. Queensland and New South Wales. A close watch should be kept on barometer. The disastrous storms in Queensland, coupled with the floods, are sufficient indication of the general type of weather, and in various parts of the east ern half of Australia there may, and-pro bably will, be a renewal of such before Ist April, hence every precaution should be taken. As stated in Jinunary, the coast of W? estern .mAustralia, north from Sharlk Bay, may. be affected by winds of the hurricaine type, and the pearling fleets should be on the alert. I am confirmed in the opinion that the southern edges of the tropical dis turblances will pass further south than usual, and their penmbrnae may even ex tend to the Bay of Plenty and Hawke's Bay-, N.Z., under curren t, from between south-east, east, north-east and north, I shifting westerly, blow ing strong, and with a very considerable rainfall, before two mouths have elapsed. These conditions "are 'imainly . due ' to abnormal sorar: in. fluienee."
