A WEATHEB FOBECAST.-" Albert Neil," Bruce, gives the following forecast for the 1913 season in the "Byre's Peninsula Tribune":-"We shall have one of the wettest Aprils for six years. People living in low-lying country are warned of flood waters. Before April 18 'we may expect useful general rains throughout the State, and extremely heavy rains in places. The raius will be caused through a coalesoence of moonsonal and sub-tropical depressions, beginning with gusty nortb-eaetily winds, veering to north-west, and later to south west with rougn seas. There will be some severe thunderstorms. For May we can anticipate further useful falls. June will have about the average rainfall, with some severe frosts. July tains will be more coastal, with some severe frosts to follow, and August useful rains, probably heavy after the middle of the month. September Hardly up to the average rainfall, cyclonic vinde between changcs. October-Steady, useful, and probably fairly general rains, aud before the middle of tbe month. November-Some heavy partial thunder storms. December- Heavy rains, and. probably before Christmas. So tbe result of the season of 1913, Irotn a farmer's point of view, will be somewhat similar to the season 1912, although tome of tbe northern areas that were unfortunate last season may be more 'ntky thie time. The squatter will have an extremily good season. OTHER WORLDS THAN OCRS CLEMJBNT WRAGGE'S splendid Tiews of the heavenly bodies. lfoth:ng like them screened before. See advt.
