 A STORMY NIGHT SHIPPING DISASTERS. ANOTHER SHIP AGROUND Port Victoria, March 13. Last night was the roughest night ex- perienced here for years. A strong south-west gale was blowing all night, and ships had a very anxious &nbsp; time. The schooner Black Albatross dis- appeared a few minutes after the crew &nbsp; were rescued last night. Only the mast and bowsprit are visible. A ship's boat from the General de Sonis has just come ashore. The second mate reports that the ship dragged her anchors last night during the gale, and touched bottom at 8 o'clock. She is now fast on a sandy bottom, but making no water. She is within 700 yards of Port Victoria jetty. A tug will be required to refloat her, and she may have to lighten part of her cargo. She has 35,920 bags of wheat aboard, shipped by Messrs. Dreyfus and Co., for the Channel. She completed loading last Saturday. She is a ship drawing 21 ft. aft, and she is lying in 19 ft. 6 in. of water, with a good tide, on an even keel, and upright. The captain is in Adelaide. &nbsp; WRECKAGE WASHED ASHORE. POSITION OF VESSEL UNCHANGED. Port Victoria March 13 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A considerable quantity of 'wreckage from the schooner Black Albatross was &nbsp; washed up on the beach to-day. The masts and the deck carried away, and the re &nbsp; &nbsp; maining portion of the hull is totally submerged. &nbsp; &nbsp; There is every probability of having to &nbsp; lighter a large quantity of the cargo &nbsp; from General De Sonis before it will be &nbsp; possible to refloat her. The vessel is in &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the same position. There is 17ft. of water &nbsp; forward and the vessel has a list to port. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Jean Bart's position is unaltered. The &nbsp; &nbsp; Mcintyre, Capella, John Lewis, Yatala and Lucknow. weathered the storm success fully &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SHIP MAY BE REFLOATED On 'Thursday morning, the president of &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Marine Board (Mr. A.Searcy) was advised by the, harbormaster at Port &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Victoria that the General de Sonis had &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dragged her anchor during Wednesday night, and was aground in 19 ft. of'water. The vessel is a French barque, of, 1,913 &nbsp; tons net register, and is fully laden with &nbsp; wheat. Her master. Captain de Flaud came to Port Adelaide from Port Victoria on Wednesday evening, in compány with Captain le Flock, of the Jean Bart, the &nbsp; other French barque which has met with misfortune at Port Victoria. As soon as Captain Flaud had transacted necessary &nbsp; business with his agents in Adelaide he &nbsp; left the city by motor car for his vessel, which it was understood,was on the bot- tom astern. The spot at which she was touching was of a sandy character. A mes- &nbsp; sage from the ship agent at Port Victoria stated that the vessel was making no water. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Messrs. L. Dreyfus & Co, of Wàymouth street, stated on Thursday morning that &nbsp; they had received advice concerning the grounding of the General de Sonis. They were informed that the vessel was lying on a sandy bottom, and was in no danger. It was expected that lightering operations would soon enable the ship to be refloated BARQUE DRAGS ITS ANCHORS The agents for the barque William Mit- &nbsp; chell (Messrs. Dreyfus & Co.) received in- formation on Thursday morning, that dur ing Wednesday night's storm in the gulf the vessel dragged her anchors while Iying &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; near the Wallaroo jetty. No damage was . done, but some delay will be caused in connection with the loading operations THE BLACK ALBATROSS &nbsp; Confirmatory news relative to the wreck &nbsp; of the Black Albatross has been received &nbsp; &nbsp; by the Marine Board. The Harbormaster &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at Port Victoria telegraphed &nbsp; &nbsp; on Thursday that this vessel was wrecked close to the beacon and had broken up, All hands were saved, said the message.. &nbsp; There are two vessels named the Albatross &nbsp; &nbsp; trading in and out of Port Adelaide. One is painted white and the other black. The latter, is the one that is wrecked. She is known as the Black Albatross. Her owners are, Messrs R Fricker and D.Deex, Port Adelaide. The vessel which is about 80 tons net &nbsp; &nbsp; register, is partly insured in the &nbsp; &nbsp; South British Insurance Company. When she was aground she was on a voyage from. Port Adelaide to PortVictoria with a cargo of 100 tons of superphosphate She left Port Adelaide on March 6, in charge of Captain C. Anderson, who had &nbsp; three seamen with him. It is understood that the vessel,which was valued as £1,ooo, is a total wreck. She was built in New Zealand. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DAMAGE AT GLENELG. VALUABLE YACHTS WRECKED. The storm did considerable damage at SIenclg, where one of the highest tides .ver known there was registered. - During the night two boats, which were moored on the south side of the jetty; broke from their moorings and were car ned. through the jetty and smashed against the 'piles of the baths. Messrs. Jenkinson ¿D3 Tomlmson's valuable 18-ffc. boat, the Bpbby, was broken completely in halves, and the Kiandra, which 'belongs to Mr, K. G Smith (eecrctary of -the' Glene'g Sailing Club) was smashed to pieces. The Bobby was worth about £80 and the Kiandra not less than £50. Both are damaged beyond repair. The .Perseverance, the Koo Aoo, and several dinghys went ashore, but were not damaged. Some 20 ft. of the shop veran- dah adjoining the Jetty Hotel was blown down, and several fences were levelled by the force of the wind. A WARNING TO SHIPPING 'HIGH OPERA" ROUND THE COASTS WHEN "DIMON" COMES ALONG. &nbsp; Mr Clement L. Wragge has further ter- rors in store for the people of South Aus- tralia when his fearsome storm "Pluto" has passed quite away. Late last night he issued the following picturesque forecast of the weather for the next week or so: "The energetic disturbance 'Pluto' will now affect the entire region between Syd ney, Gabo Island, Tasmania, and New Zea- land, and Adelaide will have finer weather under the gradual approach of relatively higher pressure. Yet 'Agamemnon' is looming up over oceanic areas south-west from the Leeuwin, and will surely affect this fair State later on, as already advised. An ugly-looking monsoonal depression, named 'Dimon' is hanging off the north- west coast north from Shark Bay, and we would. earnestly caution shipping in that locality to be on the alert. He will pro bably affect also the Northern Territory &nbsp; with rain and generally enervating con &nbsp; ditions, and may later send a tongue or &nbsp; extension into central Australia. If Agamemnon' and 'Dimon' ultimately &nbsp; coaleace, as seems,not improbable, electric &nbsp; disturbance is sure to result. In fact ere a fortnight has elapsed we expect that high opera will be. in progress around the sides and segments of the anti-cyclonic and &nbsp; cyclonic systems. Some people imagine that meteorology is a study dry as dust. &nbsp; It is nothing of the sort, it is all music from bass to treble, as the winds sweep in &nbsp; rhythm round the .contouring and gra- &nbsp; dients of the isobars.

' The Weather Office reported at noon, on Thursday:-"The Antarctic disturbance winch was noted on yesterday's weather chart covering tbe whole of South Aus- tralia and centred to the south of Kan- garoo Island, has, during the past 24 hours, considerably increased in energy. Strong north-westerly winds were experi- enced at first, but as the depression moved to the eastward the winds veered to very strong and squally south-westerlies, and &nbsp; showery ' weather- set in over, the settled areas. This morning's bulletin shows &nbsp; that the falls were chiefly light in the upper north, but over the lower north, and southern districts the amounts were heavier. A number of stations regis- tered more than half an inch, while over the eastern side of the Mount Lofty &nbsp; Ranges several places gauged over an inch. The highest fall was 133 points at &nbsp; Mount .Barker. The disturbance is now centred to the east of Tasmania, and barometers in this State were rapidly rising under the influence of an approaching high-pressure, system. - Fresh and squally south-westerly s winds 'and some passing showers may be expected at- first, chiefly in the south and south-east, but weather condition's will quickly moderate and be come fine, generally."
