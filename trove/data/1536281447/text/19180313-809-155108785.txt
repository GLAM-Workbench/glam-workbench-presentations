 MR. WRAGGE'S PREDICTION. Renewal of Cyclone Foretold. Iii Auckland on 3rd February Mr. Cle ment Wnigge, the well-known Australian meteorologist., predicted that further atmospheric disturbances would occur in the southern tropics, including the north ern portion of Ne\v Zealand. 'Atmospheric conditions,' Mr. Wragge said, ''are very perturbed within lower lati tudes than that of Auckland, rypecin'dy over all North Oaipc, the Kermadces, Tonga, Fiji. New Caledonia, Norfolk Island, and the coasts of Queensland and New South Wales. A close watch should be kept on barometer. The disastrous storms in Queensland, coupled with the floods, are sufficient indication of the general type of weather, and in various parts of the east ern 'half of Australia there may, and pro bably will, lie a renewal of such before 1st April, hence every precaution should be ! taken. As stated in January, the const of Western Australia, north from Shark Bay, may be affected by winds of the hurricane type, and the pearling fleets should be on ?the alert. I. am confirmed in the opinion that the southern edges of the tropical dis turbances will pass further south thau usual, and their penumbrae may even ex tend to the Bay of Plenty and Hawke's Bay, N.Z., under current.', from between south-cast, east.,' north-east and north, shifting westerly, blowing strong, and with a very considerable rainfall, before two months have elapsed.. These conditions are mainly due to abnormal solar in fluence.' - ' . . j
