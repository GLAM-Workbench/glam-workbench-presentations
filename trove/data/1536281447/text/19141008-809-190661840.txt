 , THE DRY SEASON- " EXPERTS DIFFER. A GLEAM OF HOPE. ABUNDANT RAINS FOLLOW DROUGHT. Mr. Clement Wraggc has prophesied coven years of drought. . Mr. H. A. Hunt, Commonwealth Met urologist., is content with one year. 1'ectcrduy lie was particu larly emphatic in nointinc out tieit the season following a drought., and particu larly a severe drought, has been marked by abundant rains. In support of this view he quoted the drought of 1888, which was- followed by a very wet year. In Victoria, during 1888, -the average rainfall was 19.7 inches. In 18S9. it was 32.71 inches. The 1002 average of 18.55 inches preceded 27.45 inches in 1U03. This was just as marked in New South Wales. Mr. Hunt's explanation of this was that when the interior of Australia was very- dry the solar summer radiation became intense, causing an inflow of moist winds from tile tropics. Tlie serious condition of Victorian crops was chiefly due to the failure of the whiter rains in the last two years. Victoria relied nn winter rains for subsoil water, and the failure of the spring rains had left nothing in reserve. Vic toria, Mr. Hunt stated, had three distinct sources of rainâ€” (1) southern storms, which also benefited South Australia and south ern Western Australia, though their pre dominance 'made Queensland and Aow South Wales suffer from lack of ram.; (2) tropical depressions, whose predomi nance, as was fine case this year, benefited Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales, to tlie detriment of southern ares"! (3) anti-cyclonic conditions, which benefited solely- the eastern littoral of Anstralia. This season the southern storms have failed.
