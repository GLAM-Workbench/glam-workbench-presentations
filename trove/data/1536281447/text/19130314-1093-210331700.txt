 A WAKNING- TO SHIPPING' ..HIGH OPERA" HOUND THE OOA.-ii WHEN "DIMON" COJiES ALONG. Mr- Clement L. Wragge has further ter rors in store for the people of South Aus tralia when his fearsome storm "Pinto" .has passed onite away. late last night he issued the following picturesque forecast of the, weather for the next week or so:- ? '"The energetic disturbance 'Pluto' will now affect the entire region between Syd ney, Gabo Island. Tasmania, and New Zea land, and Adelaide will lcive liner weather under the gradual approach of relatively higher pressure. Yet 'Agamemnon" is looming up over oceanic areas south-west from the Leeuwin, and will surely afiect this fair State later on. as already advised. An ugly-looking mdnsoonal depression, . named 'Dimon'" is hanging off the north-/ west coast north from Shark Bay, and we! would earnestly caution shipping in that locality to be on -the alert. He will pro bably affect also the Northern Territory with rain and generally enervating con ditions, and may later send a tongue or extension into central Australia. If 'Agamemnon' and "Dimon' ultimately coalesce, as seems not improbable, electric disturbance is sure /to result. In fact ere a fortnight has elapsed, we expect that high opera will be in progress around the sicks and segments of .. the anti-cyclonic and, cyclonic systems. iconic people imagine that meteorology is a study dry as dust. It is nothing of the sort, it is all music from bass to ttible,- as the winds sweep in [ rhythm round the contouring and gra- | dients of the isobars. Moj*e anon." 1
