 OFFICIAL WARNINGS. Without commenting upon the prediction of Mr.Wragge in New Zealand that there wiould be a renewal of cyclonic disturbances in Queenlsland before 1st April, the officials of. the Commonwealth Meteorological B-a reau point out that no prophetic instinct was necessary to render such a general prediction possible.' For years past the publicattions of the bureau had shown by maps and bulletins that the thdrricane sea son for the north-east coast of Queensland extends from January to April, and that the rain and storm periods for practically all parts of the Commonwealth have been ascertained as thce result of many years' experience and the collection of data by thousands of observers. Forecasts in vague general terms were of little value to mari ners and the mercantile community. What the people of North Queensland and. the traders and mariners needed were specific warnings. The burea. used every effort to supl)ly 'these, together witih implicit in structions to shipping. Four days' notice had been given of the Mackay storm, and a waring concerning the cyclone reported in "The Age" of Tuesday had been issued on Friday last 'his latter warning also had been supplemented by detailed instructions on Sunday.
