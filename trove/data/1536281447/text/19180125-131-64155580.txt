Some years ago Mr Wragge was known all over Aus tralia as a weather forecaster whose predictions gave rise to much amusement not necessarily because they were wrong, but for the reason that they were invariably placed before the public in a striking, and often entertaining, manner. What ever his merits as a meteorologist, Wragge was an excellent showman. Such terms as "monsoon" 'cyclone,' 'depression" and "disturbance" had no attractions for him. He referred to call the cyolone, "Hughes"; the depression, "Irvine" ; or the dis turbance, 'Mannix" ; or whatever names were prominent, in the poli tical world at the time. Then the public would get a pronouncement something like this: "Prepare for the worst -'Mannix'-or it might have been "Barton"-is coming. Drought stares the farmer in the face. Conserve your supplies of water immediately, for there are days of trial ahead." If the drought came, Wragge would adopt the attitiule of "I told you so. If it did not, Wragge relapsed into obscurity. Only temporarily, however, for like the politicans, Wragge invariably "came back" at the first opportunity. It is said that his gardens at Birk enhead suggest a corner of the South Sea Islands, and that visitors find much entertainment in his descriptions of the constellations. Punch.
