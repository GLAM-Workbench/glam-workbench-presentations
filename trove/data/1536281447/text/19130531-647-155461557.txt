 GENERAL CONFERENCE. ^^S IT 1 Lj KiN1 hiD OUT, ,it_was a fortunate circum stance that the General Conference was post- . poned from the 22nd of May to the 12tli ? of '.Times. The floods in the Hunter Valley seriously ' interfered with tlie railway traffic last week, and would have prevented the delegates from reaching Brisbane at tlie date originally named. At the time of this pres ent writing, the weather is still unsettled, and Mr. Clement Wragge has predicted another cyclonic dis turbance as likely to occur. We can only hope that the fates will be propitious, and that nothing will occur to prevent the Conference assembling in its full strength in Brisbane on the evening of the 12th proximo. Active preparations are being made in the northern capital for the reception and entertainment of the visiting delegates, and for tlie public meetings that are to form part of the programme. In addition to the opening session, there will be a welcome ban quet and the official opening of King 's College during the first week. A Foreign Missionary meeting, Metho dist ..Family Gathering, Young People's Demonstr: tion, and Public Questions Evening are fixed for the second week: The' speakers -will- be selected from the several State Conferences. Owing to local circum stances, there has been great delay in the issue of the Conference Agenda, but we hope that it will lie in the hands of the delegates before this paragraph sees the light. We are making special arrangements for a good report of the Conference proceedings, and hope to publish one or two specially illustrated num bers during its currency.
