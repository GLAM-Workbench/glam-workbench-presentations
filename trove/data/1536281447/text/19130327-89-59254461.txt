 A PICTURESQUE FORECAST. Mr. Clement Wragge has supplied us with the following special advice and fore cast, dated Bum, Wednesday:â€” Anti- cyclonic, or high, pressure is now influenc ing South Australia, and, for a time, Oie weather will improve, such conditions mak ing easterly. Yet the coasts of Victoria and New South Wales (including Sydney) will shortly experience more nasty souther lies and rough seas with further rain squalls, so let shipping and passengers by eea take heed. Within 10 days from date the antarctic disturbance named 'Ulysses' now slowly approaching the Leeawfa will affect, more or less, all southern parts of the Commonwealth. As his ugly eastern umbra advances the winds wiH set in from north-east with an increase of temperature, and shift to north-west and west, and a re newal of weird cloud-picturea and local dust-blows, followed' by more rain_ and south-westerly squalls. A new and suspi cious-looking monsoonal dsturbanee named 'Anan' is Detween Shark Bay and Java, and we by no means like the prospect in the neighbourhood of Cossack and the far north-west of Australia. The monsoon 'Tekel' will cause more disturbance and rain in Queensland, and looking at affairs ali round we expect a fine extravaganza from piping treble through dulcet alto to rolling bass within or during the period be the sweetest music. 'TJlyeses' is likely to play high jinks in Maorfland before a fort night has gone by, and also over the Tas man Sea, preceded, however, by tempor arily finer weatiher as the high pressures surge, in swinging rhythm, eastward.
