(From Mr. Wragge's weather report). Dark, smoky clouds are in the sir-.. The lightning livid fiits, And evil shadows hurry br — The air is full of WHITS! Tho Perry-helion is reached, And wo are sure afraid, Perchance the vessel will be beachcd Through this disLi-acting 'Wade.' Where'er a Will-is there's a way, Yet in the gathering storm Large cpectrel chapes arc ?^fathering' Grey ; . Wo sec- their lines trwrnje- ' Charles Gregory's penumbra falls , And casts a lowering shade — The lookout at the foretop calls : 'Hero comes tho cyclone, 'Wade!'' Old Jim McGowen takes the wheel, Bill 'Olman goes below — Wo mark tho shuddering vessel's heel By Jinks, it's going to blow ! The sails are reefed, t lie hatches down (Tho weather braces frayed). Yet, p'raphs we'll fetch old IlofTis Town Despite tho typhoon Wade!*' —HELEN BLAZES.
