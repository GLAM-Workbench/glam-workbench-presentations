A rural editor gives the following hint:—"The fellow who can play billiards, smoke cigars, have six penny drinlts, shout for others, trip it to Sydney, go to the races, etc., should not overlook the fact that he owes us a couple of quid." "D'yer see that there old cove com in' outer Jones' pub?" remarked the way-back leg-puller to a new arrival. 'Well, 'e's the c'nampeun boozer ov this locality. He's been drunk fur a. quarter ov a century, an' if 'a wos ter wake up some mornin' an' find 'imself sober I do believe the shock would kill 'im Twelve months ago 'e wos bitten by a tiger snake, an' badly bitten, too." 'Did the man die?" the new chum isked. "No," replied the bushman, 'but the snake got blind paralytic drunk." Beauty is only skin deep, but curves is curves. "The Secret of Smart Dress," runs a headline in a contemporary. Some of the costumes we have seen recently bad nothing secret about them at all. "Johanna" tells this one in the "Bul letin"—An exalted military gentleman in Melbourne found himself beset by an untidy young woman of about 25 in a suburban street the other morn ing. "Vo»'re , ain't you? Well, Bill can't ^o to the war." "My good woman, I " "I tell yeh straight. Bill can't go to the war, an' 'e won't, so there. Bill's engaged t' me; then he goes and enlists t' fight the Ger mans. Well, he won't go, see. He's said he'll marry me, 'n' he ain't goin' t' get off 6o easy. I give you my word."

If everybody on earth spoke the truth and nothing but the truth for twenty-four hours, we should And our selves well over the brink of the great est social revolution the world has ever known. Last week (writes "Gossip," of the "Stock and Station Journal") I had two schoolboys staying with me, who were on their way from Bedale's School, in Petersfleld, Hants, to Scot land. I took them to all the thingB we had time for, including the "White City," and the play of "Grumpy," at the New Theatre. They had the time of their lives. We visited the Tower of London, and they saw the "Traitor's Gate," the site of the scaffold whore people used to be shortened, the Idle soldiers, the ancient "Beefeaters," and all the armor and the guns and Bwords and crossbows, and weapons, of mur der. They were greatly interested, and when we came out I said, "Now, hoys, what interested you most about the Tower? What is the strongest im pression that you bring away from the old place?" The bigger and older of the two (nearly 15) said:—"Well, my strongest Impression, after seeing all the armor and the weapons of war is that the people of those times were fools."

Why it should be so even Mr. Wragge doesn't profess to know, but it has been the case frequently in the past. A happy nionsoop struck the north last week, and it was to the extent of 21 inches in one part of the tropics. Though this is nothing to talk about in those climes where during the monsoon time any place north of Townsville which doesn't get its ten Inches or so of rain a week considers itself in the throes of a fearful drought, the fact remains that the monsoons are early this season, and if history repeats it self we are going to have a summer broken up by Southern Ocean anti-&lt; cyclones which spell rain for the south of the continent. The pearl fishers at Thursday Island and Darwin have a motto to the effect that an early monsoon means a placid summer, and when they have a placid one we have a wet one. We can do with it.
