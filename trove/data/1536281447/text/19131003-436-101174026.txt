 , GOllSESPOWBE^OE, YANKO IRRIGATION SCHEME. Sir, — Hero is an instance of what the public would have to put tip with, if we had . a leasehold, system of land tenure only and our Government the landlord, which we can; see /going on at ithe Yanko irrigdtiori area. At Leeton : 14 business blocks,. averaging slightly ovel' Qtip quarter acre each, were lately gazetted io'r' rental' at an average upset price of £13 per. lot. —on a five per cent, freehold '?? basis equal to: £1040 an acre. For one-quarter acre residential sites £6 a year rent, equal to £480 an acre freehold on a ; five per cent, basis. Reappraisement is to talce place at' tile end of -.first1 25 years, and every- 20 years thereafter. ' .The more industrious the' holders 'in, iiiakiiig the town go ahead, the gi-'erfter, , the rdnt tha^ ; niay . be ex pected. : ai the , ^ny of , ea'e'h': -fcerril .- No w . ' at Harden ilidre lia«! oee'n a kee-n deitlJlnq for building sites. Business one's have ^old up., to £9; a foot; and at Murru'mb'urrah £16 a. foot. Sites for -residences bring £25 to £46 a,quartei;. acre. Tlie demand for houses far exceeds the supply. -The Lands Department lately ofrer.ed.- some' (fuarlier acre blocks' in a central position in .tiar den at £1 per , annum . rental, reapp'raise liient' .it end. of 25 years;- ~etc. Not. one has b'ceir ajjpiied. for— the tenure won't be accepted. . In the first place, note the dif ference in the 'value of residential sites. £600 a year at Leeton, with an iincei{tain future (a new township). ;/ ^£1 a year . at Harden, where . over 350 railway : employes., are permanently settled,, and the centr,e of a. large farming district. /At Harden' the Crown has to compete with 'the. owners of freehold, land, who are' subdividing s'ani^ for resideijtial sites. At Leeton the Irri gation Trust, being th'6 sole l owners, can make their own terms,' and are doing so with a vengeance. Five blocks are ? ga zetted at Yanko, available early next month, one nearly two acres; annual rent £2/8/, capitalised at 5 per cent.~ equal to ' £100 an acre. Another of 105 acres, ca-- pital value £2151/10/, .or. about £20/10/ an acre ('Gazette,'' page 5656); --^ These lands were lately bought by. the Irrigation Trust at about £3/10/ an acre/ ...Mr. C. Lee, ex-Minister for. Worksy said ..the .irrigation biocks:,at , Yanko are, the, cheapest m the world. Mr. JPrefle, the Minister for Lands,, says the^ Ia^nd is .worth £100 an acre. Tlie; Yanko irrigation, land's , are .''classed equal, to that at the Goulburn Valley in . vic toria (see Mr. L. A. B] Wage's report, in 1905): There the lands are offered free hold -t. from £15 to £18 : an 'acre. By paying 6 per cent, on the capital : value ? and interest at 4 per ceiit.,' both are paid off in 30 odd years/ This is for land' about 100 miles from ' Melbourne. .At Yanko, 350 miles from Sydney, '2| per cent, is charged on the Yanko subdivision, averaging £23/10/ an acre capital' value,, or o per cent, on' £11/15/ (the actual cost): and on the Mirrool subdivision 2\ per cent, on capital value.iof £29 an- acre, or 5 per cent, on £14/10/ an acre^— land that is . reappraised every, 25' years, with perpetual' residence. It it. '.to, be wondered at that, although over 10,000 persons in spected the, Yanko blocks, only about 500 have been^ taken, i and some of these are, now ' being abandoned; also .that, although £7000 have: been expended in an up-to-date butter : factory, there are only about 30 cream suppliers— and cows practically found. With the result that every pound of butter now being turned out at Yanko must cost, ab least .10/ per lb, '? Arid: this is what our Labor Govern-; ment has. brought our '.first'* large 'national irrigation, scheme to.— rY.ours trulv, ;-. ? :; ROBERT GIBSON. to the Editor of the 'Albury Banner.'' ', ? : Sir,TT;A paragraph has appeared, in a: Melbourne. ..paper which stated that Sena tor Maughan had requested ' in the Sen ate that. a more efficient systeiu of wea ther-wai^ning stations should, be. estab lished in the cyclonic areas along the Queensland coast, and that the Common wealth Meteorologist had intimated that the Brisbane Observ.a/tory is not/ up-to- date. For 16 ''years' I was head of the1 Queensland ' Meteorological Service, and during that time I 'established / (as Miv Robert1 ? Philp, a former1 Premier, fully .admitted) a meteorological and Aveathei warning system1 second to nono in the world. Everything was first-class when 1/ left Queensland in ? 1903, and, as everyone knows, 1; used to issue weather ?'? forecasts' for every ic part of Australasia, ; which' /wore verified to: 95 per cent, in accuracy,- Mr. Hunt has done me a cruel, , wrong; and I can onl.v look to. an ../iinpartial, and just, public .and . press, for , some measure , .of redress.
