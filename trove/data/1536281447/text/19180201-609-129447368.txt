Word has been received that Private Thomas O'Connor, of The Sisters, has been admitted to the 1st Southern General Hospital, Birmingham. England, suffering from gunshot wounds in the back-. Pte. O'Connor left Australia on the 19th February, 1917, on board the S.S. Ballarat -which was torpedoed on Anzac Day, April 25, 1917, at the en &nbsp; tra nee to the English Channel. He be longed to the 5th Battalion and had seen &nbsp; several months' of active serviec in &nbsp; France. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was a great rush at the Warr nambool railway station on Monday when the window was thrown open for the sale of -race train tickets, and in the 1 crush a man was seen to snatch up a ticket without paying for it-. He im mediately dashed off and was lost it) tlje crowd. It was a daring and smart- piece of work, but it was not done so quickly that the raihvsly/olHcial had not- had time to note the number of the ticket. Fail ing to discover the culprit the railway men immediately communicated .with ' the Camperdown polico station, and the . re sult- was that Constable A. W. Dainty collected the ticket and the man in possession of it on arrival in Camperdown. lie was arrested ay evening A^bro%m-'TO3rr^jr"0Vinii. J.P° and charged with the theft- of a railway ticket, and remanded to appear at) Warr nambool. The accused, who gave the name of Alfred Joseph Schultz, was re turned to Warrnambool in rlia rge of Con stable A'Hearn the same evening. Ho made a statement, to the effect, that he was at present out of work, and admitted taking the ticket.

Players from Warrnarabool, Grasmere, Terang, Mortlake, Deninngton, and the surrounding districts will be present. The tournament will be held on the School Tennis Court, which is m good order. The ladies of the Red Cross Society will supply afternoon tea, and in addition there will be iced drinks, ice creams, fruit salads, nnd all the sweetest and. nicest edibles. Valuable trophies for the competition have been donated by Mr. Mainland, of Warrnambool, and Mr. Powling. of Framlingham. The Fram-, Iingham Red Cross is a very live concern and the ladies who work so hard for such a splendid cause deserve all the assistance that- can be obtained. A Cobrico correspondent writes:—"In common with all parts of the Western District, farmers of Cobrico are experienc ing difficulty in securing sufficient sup plies of mill offal. In fact much more could be advantageously used than is available, and the men on the land are consequently suffering to an extent. In the fourse of conversation a prominent local fanner informed me that lie was of opinion that, so as not to be continually hampered in this direction, the dairymen and pig breeders would in future grow more feed for their own use, and so bo independent of the city mills. He added that that was the course lie was following, and pointed out that the decision of the Directors of the Cobden Butter Factory to instal a grinding plant opened up a wiiy out of the difficulty. Crushed oats, he stated, were equally as good for cattle as bran, while the supply of pig feed could be made up by grinding the damaged wheat which the Government is now* letting out at a reduced rate, as j well as other grain grown by the farmers. This \youId make an excellent substitute J.for pig feed. The plant at Cobden Butter i Factory will very shortly commence operations, when the situation as regards food for cattle and pigs should almost immediately become more satisfactory. The serious snortage of mill offal will probably have the effect of making the men engaged in the primary industries relv more upon their own efforts, and tho feeling is that in the future thev will grow grain to be turned into feed for their own cows and pigs." ' Mr. Marchant, expert consulting optician, will visit Terang on Monday, 4th February, and may be consulted at tho Commercial Hotel from 1.30 to 6.30 p.m. * j Mr. John Tehan, of Dixie, has received the following letter, dated France. .Nov ember 19, 1917, from hia lew. Private ) Jack Tehan:—"I am quite well and battling along,_ living a day at a time. \\o are out of the trenches for a rest, I in a good big town, and are having a fair time; but the worst of it is the' good tiriles don t last. But we cannot { growl, as things could be a lot worse, W e expect to put in a good winter, and 1 that is a lot. You have no idea what j a winter is like here. I have not met any of the'other boys for a few weeks, but I think they are all well, AVe have had some big fights this last few months and we are more than lucky to all "at out with a whole skin. A good niany°of the lads from our way have gone west. Ion will have heard of them before vou get this note. You will be pleased to hear that I have the D.C.M. I was n '"ew days ago by General •-U" W Mliam Birdwood ; so vou see I have not done my punch. I hope to win a V.C. yet. I will send the medal home as soon as I get it.

The would-be thief is set down to be an amateur from the circumstance that he was unable to gain admission through the door which he damaged somewhat ■ii an endeavor to open. The fact that the noise he made was audible in Mr Murphv s hotel resulted in his being disturbed. He immediately decamped and so far his identity has not been dis covered. .Speaking at a meeting of members of the Rejected Volunteers' Association in the Melbourne Tow,, Hall on Wednesday night, Mr. Donald Mackinnon, M.L.A.". Director-General of Recruiting, said ho , ei'n appalled to learn that 27,000 men had been rejected in Victoria. It, seemed to him that there must be some thing wrong with a scheme which turned to 7X' r" Vr"V T'h'; ^Wl thp P],,ck 10 otTcr to fight.

It is claimed that this road, apart from the enormous pleasure to be derived from it by thousands of tourists, will be a sound business proposition, and will bring vast sums of money annually into the towns and watering places en route. It will open up magnificent country still in its virgin state, and capable of growing any thing. The scheme altogether is a big .one, and deserves the serious consideration of residents throughout the area to be served. The Mayor of Geelong will ^elaborate the scheme at this morning's meeting, and is hoped there will be a largo attendance at the Mechanics' Hall at.the appointed hour. It will bo of interest to users, and dairymen generally, that the L.K.G. Milker still retains the premier position with the dairying community. During this year sales have eclipsed all pre vious records. Users who have bucket plants can hare them converted to the overhead pulsator and delirery systems (which haTe been in use in New Zea land and New South Wales for the past six years) at a reasonable cost.
