 i WEATHER CYCLES AND COMETS Mr. W. H. Webb, Bathurst, writes :-Earl; in March Mr. T. W. Keelo gavo an interest lng account of bis investigations on wen thor cycles, und quoted from tho Biblo i support of his theory that "tho 171-yea cycle is tho true periodicity." Ho studio tho Barling Rivor and Laka George floo ?records, - and from thc latter says : . ,"I clearly .shows a period of 57 years." Frbf "tho annual inundations of tho Nile as fa back as 1786 and up to 1905. . .'.'.. i became evident that its period must' :.-b either 114 years or 177 years." Thon h quotes the. late Mr. Symons on Britts rainfall showing 57 years, and histórico events from Walford's and other catalogue as showing 171 years as tho ."regular ir tervnls." Concerning the, 0.71 years cycle I wrote soma timo- ago that lifo was to. short to worry over- a 171-years' cycle and I obBÖrvo that Mr. T. E. Willis is ,o tho samo opinion. It is interesting to sc that Mr. Keele admits that "there wer evidences that . some mysterious influenç affected tho weather every 19 years." Wliei I first road ot Mr. Keele's 171 years' Cycle some "months ago, I wondered whether li. eyer thought- of . a' peculiarity in'his1:? mid Ings, viz., that all of his arguments' ' sup port tho 19 years'' cy'clo,Vso:.!ably",wörke( out for some.time hy .tho late Mr. Russell inasmuch as ha names - a57-ybhrs'¿~ cycle which; is really! .three periods bf j: 19, fyears and his 171-years -cycle is also-, throe?- per, iods, but .of 57'years,'and nine ofthb .1! yoórs cyclo.'

September .,11, ,1908,, thai "tho rainfall in Australia willi now. fall, off but tho coming drought will -probably-.bi not so severe as the'last," in January . 'ol 1909, when I had completed some investi- gations after soyorol months ot very;"'dry weather, I \vroto that good rains wore., not far off. Only d few days later excellent rain foll,. January finishing with 8.70..pbiht'E at Bathurst, nnd tho your turning-but one of tho best for'nine yearB,-not-only, herd, but all 'over tho State. It is now Just 12 months since I wrote regretting that' ' tho Coramonw'cnlth Meteorology Department did not publish tho valuable' Information ' that tho lato Mr. Russell used to. give, - and, as people woro complaining-bitterly about..tho dry spell then prevailing,-especially about Sydney and the South-Coast, both /'being about one-third short, tho . Hunter ! and Manning ono'-quarter .short; 'tho'central west slopes tho same short, tho north coast one-tenth, and south tableland ohc-twclfth short, I said-that Borne of . them, might, re^ asouably expect early relief. ? Every> ono'.bl these had magnificent, rains, and .finished up the year 1009 with great Increases. And since than greater rains hove fallen, even t'o. soverc floods, in several ; parts;.'and waterspouts havo boan sceii* on tho" ocean; Tho important question to now ,'cbnsldor ls: Whnt is probable after tho fearful pours in Europe, on the ocean, and , Bomb parts of'Australia ? The : long dry-spalls since March IQ last, when 114 points fell, and 'only 41 points on April 18, and lion April 24, .together with severo frosts, and good threatenings, but all going away, and other 'bad signs, ona ls . reluctantly com- pelled to fell that somo "mysterious. - in- fluence" is nt work interfering with- tho 19 years'cycle, and that possibly Mr.' Clement' Wragge's drought has commenced. . . Tho passing of the stars Venuls arid Jupi- ter brought nico rains. Tho Aurora 'Aus-, trails brought lovely rains.. Tho. solar eclipse apparently did nothing. It,'is Hui; loy's comet that wo-now look to as tho,, causo of the trouble. ' The last great comet that wo remember was that of 1881. The ' year 1880 was a drought, and this con- tinued lintil 1880 ; and thousands ol live stock died in this . State and Queensland. Creeks dried up about .Bathurst and Orange , that "were never known dry before, lt .has been said that it is 74 years since Halley's comet appeared until' now. That takes us back to 1836 (it appeared in 1885). As a boy. I wall remember my late grandfather often speak of tho fearful drought of 1889. It was long and bad ; and, as wei usually speak of them from the closa, it ls most likely to have started about .1835, ! As severo droughts followed tho appear-: ance of tho coniots In 1885 and 1881, wo. fear it may be a dry time during tho next ' two or three years, notwithstanding! tho' fact that great southern anti-cyclonic belt.' is in tho rainy season. Wo'hàvb had! ,thç. assurance of Mr. Wragge ? that tho drought ' will .not bo so severo as tho . last ;, honed wo 'can rest assured-that tho country: will. survive it.' .'.," '''-?. ''."
