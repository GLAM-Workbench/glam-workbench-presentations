 NOTES AND NEWS THE SITST SPOTS. Mr Clement Wragge writes: Great changes have taken place in the great sun spot or eolar storm since Thursday. It has increased in energy, and is now about 27,000 miles in diameter, arid the smaller solar disturbances, also noted on the 19th, have largely amal gamated with the. main nucleus. That the earth is responding and wijl vet respond, to the etheric vibrations'hiir] ed adrift by this great solar cyclone, is certain, and we may expect to hear that abnormal tidal action of seisniis or volcanic disturbance lias taken place in such parts of the earth as ore most liable to be so affected. Auroral dis plays may be expected in high lati tudes.  CORRESPONDENCE WEATHETR FOHHOASTIXG. justice.
