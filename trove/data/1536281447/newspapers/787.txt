 The Dry Season. EXPERTS DIFFER. A GLEAM OF HOPE. ABUND ANT 11 A INS FOLLOW DROUGHT. -? ' Mr- Clement Wrag-ge-lias pro phesied seven years of drought. Mr H. A. Hunt, Commonwealth Meterologist, is content with one year. He is particularly empha tic in pointing out that the sea son followiug;a drought, and par ticularly a severe drought, has been maiked by 'abundant rains. In support of this view he quotes the drought of 1888, vvhich was followed by a very wet year. In Victoria, during 1888, the aver age rainfall was 19.7 inches. In 1889 it was -32.71 inches. ? The 1902 average of 18.55 inches pre ceded 27.45 inches in- 1903. This was just as marked in New South Wales. ? - . Mr Hunt's explanation of :this is that when. the-interior of Aus tralia is very dry the solar sum mer. radiation becomes intense, causing an inflow of moist winds from the tropics. ' The serious coudition of Victorian crops' is : chielly'due to the failure of the winter rains in the past two years. Victoria relies on winter raius for subsoil water^and the failure of the spring, rains has -left .nothing in reserve. Victoria^ Mr Hunt states, has three dis tinct sources of rain â€” (1) south ern storms, which also benefited South Australia and Southern Western Australia, through their predominance made Queensland and New South Wales suffer from lack of rain ; (2) tropical depres sions, whose predominance, as was the case this year, benefited Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales, to the detri ment of southein areas ; (3) anti cyclonic conditions, which bene fited solely the eastern litteral of Australia. This season the south ern storms have failed.
