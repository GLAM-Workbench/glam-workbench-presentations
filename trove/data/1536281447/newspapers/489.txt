 looking Ahead MR. WEAGGB'S FOREOAST. Mr. Wrag«e has computed forecasts for the seasons of Australia up till 1930, and these, he says, are applicable to Now Zealand, with slight) modifica tions, owing to physical and geugraphi cal reasons. Daring 1914 and part) of 1915, he says, the rainfall, t'akinsf Australasia as a whole, will be under the average. This by no means implies that there will be no rain. On the contrary, good intervening rains will occur, and the last part of this period ' will be better than the first. From the middle of 1915 onwards, the rainfall . will markedly increase, and from 1916 to 1920, inclusive, -the seasons will- be distinctly good, with abundanb pre cipifcation. After 1920 She . rainfall will begin to steadily fall off, and the worst part of the next great ' under-average ' period will be 1923 and 1924. Australian* will be Just. fieri in calling thab a drought. In 1925, matters will begin to improve, and good seasons will pre vail frooo 1925 to 1930.' These; forecasts, explained Mr. Wragge, are mainly- based on the physical condition of the sun with respect to its maxima and min;.ma moods, moving in cycles of eleven i years. Just now we are nearing the ' erd of the solar minimum — or the j period when v.he fearful cyclonic wiads round the sun, of which we on earth j hs d no conception, were leasb violeob. j The maximum period would com- i mtence at the end of 1915, and until then, although he did noo except the seasons to be so bad as they had been, i abnormal raice must nob be anticipated, j Intervening ( rains in New Zealand t should give a heavier fall than in Australia. In the drought he pre dicted, New Zealand would not suffer to the same extent as Australia, owing to i-s climate being Hnsular, whereas that of the latter was continental. -
