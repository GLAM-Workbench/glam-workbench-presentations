 mr. wragge's prediction. RENEWAL OF CYCLONE FORE TOLD. In Auckland on February 3 Mr. Clement Wragge, the well known Australian meteorologist, predicted that further atmospheric distur- bances would occur in the southern (tropics, including the northern por- | lion of New Zealand. "Atmospheric conditions," Mr. j Wragge said, "arc very perturbed within lower latitudes than that of Auckland, especially over all North j Cape, the Kermadecs, Tonga, Fiji, New Caledonia, Norfolk Island, and the coasts of Queensland and New South Wales. A close watch should be kept on barometer. The disas trous storms in Queensland, coupl ed with the flood, are sufficient in- UiCcLulUU ( ) 1 Lilt/ L'llL/Lill IvPc UI ther, and in various parts of the eastern half of Australia there may, and probably will, he a renewal of such before April 1, hence every pre caution should be taken. As stated in January, the coast of Western Australia. norLh from Shark Bay, may be affected by winds of the hur ricane ,1-ype, and "the pearling fleets should 'be on the alert. I am con firmed in the opinion that the sou thern edges of the trapieal distur bances will pass further south than usual, and their penumbrae may even extend to Urn Bay of Plenty and TJawke's Bay, N.Z., under cur rents from between south-east, east, north-east and north, shifting wes terly. blowing strong, and with a very considerable rainfall, before two months have elapsed. These conditions are mainly due to ab normal solar influence."  7 : N D W ARNIN &V D i YEN/ " ' ; : . -'Mf/1 Clement'' AYragg.e, ,' 'writing; fl'dm' Chirtern, iri the1 N6f th-Eastqrh i district, ' rie marks . 7 .
