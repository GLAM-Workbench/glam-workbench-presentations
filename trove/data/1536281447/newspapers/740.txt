 The Loss of the Koombana. Uft, WEAGGE.S VIEW. TO THE EDITOH Sir,—Just allow ma to say. in (simple justice, that if the Central Weather Bareaa, Brisbane, bad been in existence «crr-!;be annual vote for which did not exceed £1,500 per annuam—three days' warning at least would have baen given of the recent cyclone off the North-West coaet of Australia.— Yours, etc, CLEMENT L WEAQGE Chiltern, Victoria, March 29.—From the " West Australian." W.3 agree most heartily with Mr. Wragge's views, for many readers will probably remember the success achieved by that gentleman whilst in charge of the Queensland Bureau. We remem ber particularly his prediction of a cy clone that struck Victoria in 1896 and whioh did a great deal of damage—par ticularly at Ararat—and the approach of which had been announced by Mr Wragge several -days before the visi tation. Australia is lamentedly back ward in meteorology, as a comparison with America will show. There, weather forecasting has been raised to such a fine art that the farmers follow the advice from the bureau with as much confidence as a hungry man eita down to a good breakfast. Accoiding to Mr. Wragge£1,500 would probably have saved the lives of 130 peoplB, and when we consider the milk-and-water nature of the forecasting that we re ceive in this State something more thorough and practical is urgently re quired.
