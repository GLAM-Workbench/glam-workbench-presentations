 CLEMEWT WRAGGE. Few names (says the Sydney "Sun") are as well known through out the Commonwealth as that of Clement Wragge, whose picturesque nomenclature of approaching storms was a feature of the day's reading during the tlme he was Director of the Weather Bureau in Queensland. His high-level station at Kosciusko is now a ruin, but the reputatlon that Mr. Wragge left behind him is as firm to-day, as it was when he handled and christened cyclones and tornadoes as though they, were kit tens. Interest in Mr. Wragge's work is revived by the announcement that he will arrive in Sydney on Friday and begin a series of popular lec- tures on the following Monday in the Y.M.C.A. Hall. The fact that Mr. Wragge has lost none of his pic torial imagery is shown even In the title of his lectures. "The Flight of a Soul Through Space" suggests Marie Corelli, from whom, by-the- way, Mr. Wragge received a number of letters. The erstwhile official me- terologlst repudiates the idea that he is a showman, claiming to be a meteorologist and physical astrono- mert, but his lectures, while highly educative wlll be found to be ex- tremely popular.
