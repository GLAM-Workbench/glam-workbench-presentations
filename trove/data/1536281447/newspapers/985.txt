Winds On an awful scale, with gigantic tongues of hydro gen, flame around these solar storms in exactly the same manner as do the winds around the puny cyclones of earth, ucrthern and southern hemi spheres respectively; and it must ever be remembered tliat the earth and the sun are inseparably linked together by the all-pervading wireless etherie' waves.
